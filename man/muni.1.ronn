## DESCRIPTION

**muni** retrieves San Francisco MUNI routes information and bus stop prediction
times. `muni` is mostly an exercise in implementing the core functions of the `muni`
NextBus API client.

## EXAMPLES

List all available routes:

	$ muni list
		F  F-Market & Wharves
	    J  J-Church
	   KT  KT-Ingleside/Third Street
	    L  L-Taraval
	    M  M-Ocean View
		....

Show basic route information:

	$ muni show 21
        21  21-Hayes
    21_IB1  Inbound to Steuart Terminal
    21_OB4  Outbound to Fulton St & Shrader St

Show a route and all stops using `-v` or `--verbose`:

	$ muni show 21 --verbose
	  	 21  21-Hayes
     21_IB1  Inbound to Steuart Terminal
       7499   Fulton St & Shrader St
	   ...
     21_OB4  Outbound to Fulton St & Shrader St
       6497  Steuart St & Mission St
       6501  Steuart St & Market St
       5669  Market St & Drumm St
	   ...

Show a route and all stops for a particular direction:

	$ muni show 21 outbound --verbose
        21  21-Hayes
    21_OB4  Outbound to Fulton St & Shrader St
      6497  Steuart St & Mission St
      6501  Steuart St & Market St
      5669  Market St & Drumm St
      ...

Get predictions for a bus, going a certain direction, at a given stop.
`predict` can take the formal tag names for the direction and stop, or
it will perform it's best guess.

With formal direction and stop tags:

	$ muni predict 21 21_OB4 5008
	Route 21-Hayes going Outbound to Fulton St & Shrader St at Hayes St & Shrader St:
	        2831  2 minutes

	        2842  40 minutes
	        2823  about 1 hour
